###
Also - Can we please be sure that we implement the following notes from Invision:

1. http://remixer.surge.sh/features.html - Social buttons under Testimonials, clicking on these would share Trish's story with a canned message. Can we drop the follow though?

2. http://remixer.surge.sh/features.html - CTAs under each of the features, our idea was that all of these call to actions would initiate the user to start the process of building the site. Can we please ensure that all of these redirect to https://signup.dreamhost.com/remixer/email/

3. Footer - Can we add in the DreamHost logo and make it a live link to the DreamHost site? https://www.dreamhost.com/
